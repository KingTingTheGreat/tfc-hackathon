## Mission
Our mission is to provide a convenient and accessible website for users to find the most cost effective options for prescriptions and procedures.
## Implementation
Users input their location, insurance information, and past medical purchases. We use this data to give other users the most accurate possible estimate for similar medications or procedures. We also inform users of options they have without insurance, expanding our projects accessibility and ensuring our users always save as much money as possible.
